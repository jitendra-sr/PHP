# Setting Up PHP, XAMPP, and Creating Your First Project

## Step 1: Install XAMPP

1. Download XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
3. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

## Step 2: Create Your First PHP Project

1. Navigate to the `htdocs` directory in your XAMPP installation folder (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs`).
2. Create a new folder for your project, e.g., `first-project`.
3. Inside the folder, create an `index.php` file with the following content:
   ```php
   <?php
   echo "Hello, World!";
   ?>
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/first-project`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

## Step 4: Start Coding

You can now start building your PHP application by adding more files and functionality to your project folder.
